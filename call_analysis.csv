[00:00:05] Caller: Hi, yes. I'm having a problem with my internet connection. It's been down for about an hour.

[00:00:10] Agent: I see. I can certainly look into that for you. Could I please get your account number or the full name on the account?

[00:00:16] Caller: The name is John Smith.

[00:00:19] Agent: Thank you, John. One moment while I pull up your details. [Keyboard typing sounds] Okay, I see your account. I'm not showing any reported outages in your area, but let's run a diagnostic. Are you near your router right now?

[00:00:35] Caller: Yes, I am.

[00:00:36] Agent: Great. Could you please tell me what lights are on and what color they are?

[00:00:41] Caller: The power light is solid green. The Wi-Fi light is blinking green. But the light with the little globe symbol is off. It's usually blue.

[00:00:52] Agent: Understood. Thank you for that information. It sounds like the router isn't receiving a signal. I am going to attempt to reset the connection from my end. This will take about two to three minutes. Is it okay if I place you on a brief hold?

[01:00:05] Caller: Yes, that's fine.

[01:00:07] Agent: Thank you. [Hold music begins]

[01:02:15] Agent: [Hold music ends] Thank you for waiting, John. I've refreshed the signal to your device. Could you check the lights on the router again for me?

[01:02:24] Caller: Okay, let me see. The power is green, Wi-Fi is green... ah, the globe light is now blinking blue. Now it's solid blue.

[01:02:35] Agent: That's a good sign. Could you try to open a webpage on one of your devices?

[01:02:41] Caller: One second. [Pause] Yes, it's working. The page loaded.

[01:02:48] Agent: Excellent. It looks like the remote reset resolved the issue. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[01:02:54] Caller: No, that was it. Thank you for your help.

[01:02:57] Agent: You're very welcome. Thank you for calling Tech Solutions, and have a great day.
